This is a trivial little MP3 player for node.js.  I wrote it as part of a
larger experiment with node.js.  It just reads audio files given on the
command-line and plays them through your (default) speaker.

Requires async, lame and speaker modules:
    % npm install async
    % npm install lame
    % npm install speaker

Depending on your audio back-end, you may also need ALSA headers.  On FC,
you can fetch the appropriate headers with:
    % yum install alsa-lib-devel

Run with:
    % node mp3-player.js /path/to/file.mp3

Tested on FC15.  Elsewhere, YMMV.
